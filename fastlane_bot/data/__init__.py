Static data used by the bot, including ABIs

NOTE: This directory contains static data used by the bot. Most of this data is in
json or csv files and therefore needs to be read using standard file I/O. 
The exception is ABI data which is imported as a Python data structures.

TODO: possibly this data should be provided for remote download from a server, as
the ideal update frequency is higher than the bot's release frequency.
