# How to Make your Bot more Competitive

## Overview

Typically only one bot-operator is able to close each arbitrage opportunity, making bot operation competitive in nature. The purpose of this document is to provide ideas on ways to improve your own bot. 

### Gas Priority Fee Optimization
In config/network.py there is a constant: DEFAULT_GAS_PRICE_OFFSET. This is a multiplier that increases the priority fee paid by your TX. The higher it is, the more likely your TX will get executed, but the more the TX costs. Itâ€™s set to increase by 9% by default, which is likely insufficient to be competitive. You could also design a custom function to modify the priority fee based on profit - this could likely make you competitive, but would require some work. 

### Data Throughput
Faster data means faster cycles for the arbitrage bot. The easiest way to achieve this is by using a premium plan from a data provider such as Alchemy. 

Another way to achieve this is by running an Ethereum node locally. The bot can be connected to a local Ethereum node fairly easily by changing the RPC_URL in the fastlane_bot/config/providers file. Note that some functions require an Alchemy API key, making Alchemy necessary unless the functions themselves are modified. 

These functions are in fastlane_bot/helpers/txhelpers, and include: 
* **get_access_list:** this function is optional - using it saves around 5000 gas on average per transaction.
* **submit_private_transaction:** this function is not optional, however it's possible to submit transactions directly to Flashbots. See the Flashbots Documentation for more details: https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-auction/advanced/rpc-endpoint
* **get_max_priority_fee_per_gas_alchemy:** this function is not optional, but could be replaced with custom priority fee logic. 

### New Arbitrage Modes
Currently the bot is geared towards closing pariwise & triangular arbitrage on Bancor V3 & Carbon, but it can easily be generalized for all the exchanges it supports. To do this, you would need to create a new Arb Mode file, and design the combinations that are fed into the Optimizer. A lot of the heavy lifting here is already handled, but there may be a few specific changes you would need to make to get it to work.
